# [GitHub]::Welcome()

Welcome to my GitHub universe! I am Wojciech Napierała, also known as "ScriptSavvyNinja" or "voytas75" in the digital realm. As a seasoned system administrator, I navigate the intricate landscapes of M365, Azure, and Active Directory (AD) with finesse and expertise.

My toolbox is filled with powerful instruments like PowerShell and Python, which I wield to enhance my efficiency and productivity. But my interests extend beyond the realm of code. I find solace in the pages of Sci-Fi books and intrigue in the world of cryptocurrency, both of which often serve as a source of inspiration for my work.

My passion for PowerShell is palpable. I see it as an indispensable tool in the management of modern IT systems. My GitHub profile is a testament to this belief, showcasing my projects and contributions that leverage the power of PowerShell.

When I'm not immersed in code or lost in a Sci-Fi novel, you can find me on [Instagram under the handle 'scriptsavvyninja'](https://instagram.com/scriptsavvyninja?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==). I also welcome support through my Ko-fi and [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/voytas75).

I invite you to explore my work, ask questions, suggest collaborations, and join me on this journey of discovery and creation. As I sign off my welcome message with a nod to my love for Sci-Fi, I wish you to *"Live long and prosper 🖖"*.
